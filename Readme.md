# What makes a song popular?

In this group assignment we will be working with data obtained from Spotify through the Spotify developers API.

Our ultimate goal is to build statistical models to determine what makes a song popular, and to build models to predict popularity of songs.

## Structure of the assignment

This group assignment is being segmented into two parts. 

### Part 1 - Data Processing, EDA and Modeling to Explain

In this part of the assignment you will work on some data handling and model building for explanation.

### Part 2 - Modeling for Predicting

In the second part of the assigment (will be made available next week), you will perform a validation study on several models and determine a model that works well for predicting popularity. You will use that model to predict the popularity score for a set of songs not included in the initial data.

### Working as a group

This assignment is general structured that it builds on itself. That is, performing the data processing in Question 1 should help the data processing in later parts. Several of the earlier questions provide insight that should be helpful when building your regression model. Therefore, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you DO NOT adapt the divide-and-conquer strategy many teams used on the first assignment (Alice does #1, Bob does #2, Carol does #3, and so on). Not only would this be an unfair distribution of workload, but it may delay completion of the assignment.

## Data

All data needed for part 1 of the assigment is available in the file `spr21_spotifyData.RData`. The `RData` contains five datasets and can be inported into R with the `load()` function. The datasets included are

* `artist_df` -- A data.frame containing the names, and Spotify IDs for 389 artist.  These artist were selected based on having a popular song sometime over the past 5 years on the Pop Music, Rock Music or Country charts.
* `album_artist_df` -- A data.frame mapping the artist (and their Spotify IDs) to all their recorded studio albums, including the album name, its Spotify ID, its type (album, single or compilation) and its release date (either a date or a year).
* `tracks_df` -- A data.frame with 70036 rows recording a track (i.e., song) name, Spotify track ID, an indicator determining if the song includes *explicit lyrics* and the Spotify **popularity** score.
* `album_track_df` -- A data.frame with 70036 rows but only two columns mapping all Spotify track IDs with their correspond Spotify album IDs.
* `track_features` -- A data.frame with 70023 rows record track IDs along with a series of audio *features* as reported by Spotify. This includes
   + duration_ms - the duration of the track in milliseconds.
   + time_signature - An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). Note: common time is 4.
   + danceability - Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable
   + energy - Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
   + key - The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class
   + loudness - The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. 
   + mode - Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
   + speechiness - Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.
   + acousticness - A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
   + instrumentalness - Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.
   + livenss - Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.
   + valence - A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
   + tempo - The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.





## Part 1 - Specifics

Below we outline all the individual questions to answer. The first question is for fun and is design to get you moving (proverbially). The next 3 questions involve some data processing and EDA. They are design to provide some (but not all) insight that will help you build a model. You are being tasked with making some decisions and to use knowledge we have covered since the first day of class -- yes, material from In-class 01 appears on this assignment! Many of these questions will involve data processing (think mutate, filter, group_by, joining) and may also require for you to learn some new functions.

Some other items to note: the same song may be in the data multiple times (each time with a unique track ID) because the song is released on multiple albums (original album, a greatest hits and a single). Likewise, some albums are in the data multiple times (multiple releases of an album, or a "clean" version versus one with explicit lyrics). These nuances will be addressed below.


### Question 1

Write R code to find the 15 most popular full albums (not singles) in terms of average popularity score of all tracks on the album (hint: the 15th highest average popularity score is 74.7). Your output should include the artist name, album name, album release data and average popularity score. What do you notice about release dates of thes poppular albums? How many of the artist and albums on the list do you know? How many do you think your instructor knows?

### Question 2

The variables key, time_signature and mode are recorded as numeric variables but are categorical in context. Perform any necessary data processing to treat these variables as categorical. Study the frequency of the different categories and explore the relationship between the different category levels and popularity scores. This analysis should be performed on 70,023 observations. Make note of any categories that do not seem predictive or may be combined for further analysis.

### Question 3

Study the effects of track length on popularity when track length is treated as a numeric variable, but also when it have been categorized. Categorize the duration of the Songs as such: tracks under 2 minutes and thirty seconds are considered short, while songs between 2:30 and 3 minutes and 30 seconds are "Radio Friendly". Songs from 3:30 to 4:30 in duration are "Longer Radio" songs, songs from 4 minutes and 30 seconds to 5:30 are "Long Songs" and songs over 5 minutes and 30 seconds are "Very Long Songs".

When a track by a specific artist is in the data multiple times, use the average duration and average popularity score of all replicates of the song. The resulting processed data should contain 40,827 tracks. What effect does song length appear to have on popularity? What does this imply about using song length as a predictor variable in a model? Hint: in this class we have discussed 'linear' models -- does the relationship follow that pattern?

### Question 4

Some music contains explicit lyrics (I can't believe the $#!0!@% record companies produce such things) but often "clean" versions of the same song are produced for radio play. In this question want to explore the effect of explicit lyrics on popularity scores. But rather than comparing two populations (songs with explicit lyrics versus songs without), you need to compare songs with explicit lyrics to their "clean" versions.

For example, look at the first 40 rows of the tracks_df dataset, you should notice that the first 20 rows repeat! In fact, these tracks are from the posthumous album "Legends Never Die" by the hip-hop aritst Juice WRLD. The first 20 tracks contain explicit lyrics, while the next 20 are "clean" versions of the same song. We wish to compare the popularity of the "clean" version of the song compared to the one with explicit lyrics.

Perform some data processing in R to find all songs by artists that appear at least twice in the dataset where you have two different versions of the song (one with explicit lyrics and one without). When multiple versions of the song appears with/without explicit lyrics, compute the mean popularity score of all instances. There are 3904 such songs in the data provide. Perform an analysis comparing the effect of explicity lyrics on popularity scores when a "clean" version of the song is also available.

### Question 5

Now we will process the data to use for building statistical models where we hope to predict song popularity!

Process the data such that only tracks with non-zero time signatures from studio albums (i.e., no "singles") released after 2016 with a complete record (i.e., if some variable is NA, you can remove the record) are retained. If done correctly, there will be 23,029 tracks we will use in our analysis.

### Question 6

Using the processed data from question 5, build an optimal model that best explains popularity scores. That is, find a linear model that best explains popularity scores. Which variables seem to be most influential?

This question is very open-ended. Consider all the material in this assignment and covered in class. That is, use the insight gained in questions 2, 3 and 4 from this assignment. Consider the topics covered in Module 9 for model building. Condering using categorical variables and interaction such as in Module 7. When addressing which variables seem important consider topics from Module 8. Since this question entails statistical inference, make sure to consider model assumptions (including linearity!).

Other hints: use tools covered in class such as $R^2_a$, AIC, BIC, stepwise regression and best subsets regression to help you choose an optimal model. Consider combining categorical variables (if it makes sense; e.g., time signature) like we did in the In-class 20 assignment. You may consider any methods covered in this class and some from outside the class (if you can justify). You may also utilize contextual expertise if justified.

**What to submit** -- obviously we do not want all the code and all the output for every model you consider. However, it is imperative that you step through your model building process. Provide descriptions of the models you considered and helpful tabular output on how you built this model. Make sure to address the question "which variables seem to be most influential?" with your chosen model -- remember to look beyong $p$-values and significance (feel free to read about partial R-squared).

## Submission

Submit a well-written, error free, clean, knitted markdown file to canvas. This document is likely to be quite lengthly so please only include relevant output. Summarize results from question 6 in well-formatted tables. Separate each question with its own heading. If using results from previous questions (e.g., suppose you used the code created in part N in question N+1) make a comment in your code chunk so we know where it comes from.
